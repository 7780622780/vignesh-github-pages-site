Task 6 â€” Host a Static Website with GitHub Pages

## Task Description
The objective of this task was to create and host a static website using GitHub Pages.  
I built a simple HTML webpage, styled it with CSS, and uploaded the project to a public GitHub repository.  
After that, I enabled GitHub Pages from the repository settings to make the site live.  
I then documented the process, added screenshots for reference, and submitted both the GitHub repository link and the live website link through the provided Google Form within the given submission time window.


Live Site
ðŸ”— Live Website URL:** https://7780622780.github.io/vignesh-github-pages-site/ 
ðŸ”— GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/7780622780/vignesh-github-pages-site


Steps I Followed
1. Created a project folder locally with:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css` 
2. Initialized a Git repository and committed files.
3. Created a new public repository on GitHub.
4. Added the GitHub repository as a remote to my local repo.
5. Pushed all files to the `main` branch on GitHub.
6. Enabled **GitHub Pages** from:
   - **Settings** â†’ **Pages** â†’ Select `Branch: main` and `Folder: / (root)`.
7. Waited for deployment to complete and verified the live URL.
8. Took screenshots of:
   - Repository root showing files.
   - GitHub Pages settings.
   - Live website open in browser.
9. Updated `README.md` with details, screenshots, and what I learned.
